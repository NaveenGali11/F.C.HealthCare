        <p style="font-size: 20px">Skin is the largest organ of the body that acts as a shield against harmful bacteria.Skin diseases vary from pers to person and in severity. Skin diseases are said to affect about 30-60% of the individuals world wide. They are ranked 4th in the most common causes of human illness. Most of the people tend to ignore these diseases in their early stages until they experience high abnormalities in their bodies. The YLDs from the skin diseases were more than those caused by diabetes and migraines. Skin diseases are a major problem in children. Recent school survey in India states that skin diseases range from 15 - 50% in children. The overall skin diseases rate turned out to be 68%. 53 skin diseases were identified among them out of which 15 were infectious and were present in 50% of t total children surveyed.Â 

            The main causes of skin diseases are: Lack of proper hygiene, Awareness about the disease, Genetic factors , Contact with infected skin and irritants etc.

            Most of the people just ignore these skin diseases due to lack of awareness and due to lack of medical facilities.This Covid-19 has made it difficult for the people even to consult a doctor manually.Another major problem lies with the images provided through online search results
            .If people try to identify the disease they have suffered from through online discussions, the images shown in the websites tend to be similar for two or more diseases making it difficult for the user to identify which disease he is actually suffering from.</p>
